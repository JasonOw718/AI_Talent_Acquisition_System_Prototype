## ❗ Problem Statement

In fast-growing tech hubs like Bengaluru and Hyderabad, companies are overwhelmed by thousands of job applications—many of which are unqualified or AI-generated. Recruiters spend hours manually reviewing resumes, often using outdated tools.

Key challenges include:
- 🔍 Resume spam and exaggeration
- 🧾 Inconsistent formatting (PDF/DOCX)
- ⏳ Delayed hiring and missed top talent
- 🧠 Lack of validation for applicant claims

These problems lead to longer hiring cycles, lost productivity, and poor candidate experiences. Companies need smarter, scalable systems to manage modern recruitment demands.
